<h2>Fun Facts about HM Debate:</h2>
<p>Our Horace Mann Debate Team does Public Forum Debate which includes a traditional structure with two people per team.
Many famous individuals such as Oprah Winfrey, Adam Sandler, and Nelson Mandela all were on a Debate Team when they were in High School
Public Forum generally Debates topics about foreign affairs, important national issues and domestic policy
	Public Forum Debate was First introduced in 2002</p>
	<h2> Community Out Reach </h2>
<p>Horace Mann Debate has also helped contribute to the Bronx Community. The Debate Team works with In-Tech Academy, a middle school in the Bronx, to teach and coach In-Tech Middle schoolers. Led by Ella Feiner, the initiative focuses on helping students break down debate topics and develop strong arguments. The debate team coaches them through various topics, helps them with research and practices public speaking drills. 
	</p>
	<h2> In a Debate Round </h2>
	<p>Constructive Speech: The constructive speech is the first speech of the Debate round and lasts 4 minutes. In this speech, each team introduces their main arguments, which are broken down into contentions.


Rebuttal: The Rebuttal speeches, which last for 4 minutes, respond to the constructive speeches and present additional counter-arguments that attach the evidence, analysis or logic of each arguments. The Rebuttal can address both general themes in a debate or attack specific, nuanced aspects of the round 


Summary: In the summary speech, one of the most important speeches of a debate round, focuses the round on the main voting issues and lasts 2 minutes. In the summary, the speaker condenses the arguments, responds to arguments made in the rebuttals and explains to the judge why his or her side is winning the round.


Cross Fire: Cross Fire, which lasts for 3 minutes and occurs after the Constructive, Rebuttal and Summary, is an opportunity for opponents to ask each other questions about their arguments.


Final Focus: The Final Focus is the last speech of the round and lasts 2 minutes. In the final focus the speaker explains why his or her side has won the round and also weighs which argument that was made is most important.
